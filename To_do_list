Lantera:
(A) 'Natalya is your sub' story line, basically redone from the ground up, and more additions to the Mistress/Natalya quest in general.
(A) Post office job
(R) 'Roof over your head' story line, which offers a place to stay if you have no home. Could be a homeless enclave near the park, could be a cheap ragged hotel on the outskirts of the city that Sveta should be able to afford.
(R) Hotel jobs, as described above
(R) 'Road to the Championships' story line, which picks up where the Christina quest line currently stops. You can convince the running coach to bring you along as well as Christina for running events, and the two of you would be competing against one another. Whoever does better (whoever the coach likes more, that is...) gets to run the matches. I'll let you figure out how you can get the coach to like you.
(R) 'Indebted to Bely' story line, the current events when you're in debt to Vadim Bely are very bare-bones.
(F) Some more interracial content, in some shape or form.
And of course text edits, until the scrambled machine translations are completely gone.

Up for grabs:
While working on the sexm, I was like, man it sucks we don't have boyfriends in the boyStat, we should really add them. Then I was like, yeah but then we would need to give them each a name. Then I was like we could give them a blurb of personality on the wiki FAQ that we could later add in. Like a bit about their family, goals in life etc. To give them a bit more. split them up into 3 groups, shy group, normal, bad boy, do 5 to 7 boys for each group. get a image of each one, a name for each one, a boystat entry for each one then do a personality blurb.
Then when you ran into a boy to date it would always be one of them. With them each having a name, the code could be written to never pull the same guy twice. So in different play throughs you might date the same guy, but during a single play through you should never date the same guy twice.
