!! I have gone through and added a new category of string variables, standardised to be used for descriptive writing. You will notice some duplication here -- this is for purposes of backwards compatibility, as if I completely rename and discard some of these strings,
!! extant saved games will irreparably break, and this would be Bad. One day down the line, most of the duplicated variables here can be culled, when there is a new release that warrants new saves being used, but until then the duplication needs to stay. Use of
!! strings for descriptions that do not begin with $pcdesc_ should be avoided, as it would be best to have everything standardised when moving forward into the present and future.
!! Available strings follow this format: $pcdesc_type, $pcdesc_typewordy, and $pcdesc_typerandom. The last will give a new string each time, to allow for repeatedly referencing something accurately without it becoming repetitive.  Not EVERYTHING has a wordy 
!! or even random variation, but these should work regardless -- they just may use a non-wordy, or non-random version, if it is something that does not really warrant such. 
!! There is also a special string, $pcdesc_typeinsertive, that follows the format " , descriptive text" as in, " , invitingly-glossed". Please check the master string document to see if this exists for the string you need. - xerya, July 2017

!! If the PC has vastly less breast tissue than she does silicone, use a slightly more derogatory term. There is actually not a great way to calculate this; silicone counts almost the same on all body types, even though an increase of 200cc, for example, would be vastly
!! more noticeable on a thinner body than a heavier one. I have experimented with moving where the silicone is factored in to the body shape calculations, but ultimately there is just no better way to do it than how it is now, given the things that increase the amount
!! of silicone in the PC body. The best kludge I can make is working off of stored fat (pcs_weight does actually not do the job at all, as a fat PC and thin PC are almost the same, oddly, in my tests) and making an approximation from there. The amount of the silicone
!! variable does not really equate to any particular real-life cc calculation for implant size, so we cannot go off of that. This will have to do for now.
