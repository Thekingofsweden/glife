# virginity_call

!{ 	This is to keep track of how the main character loses her virginity. It can store a different set of details for vaginal, anal and oral.
	It creates messages that can serve as responses when talking about Sveta''s virginity
	
	Details it keeps track of:
		- Type of virginity
		- Name or description of who takes her virginity
		- Wether of not Sveta knows this person or persons
		- If she was forced or not
		- Rough or gentle
		- What state Sveta was in at the time
		- Where it happened
		- What object was used (Leave blank if it''s a dick!)

$ARGS[0] 'vaginal', 'anal' or 'oral'
$ARGS[1] is for the name of the sexual partner or description
$ARGS[2] 'unknown', 'known' or 'unaware'
$ARGS[3] 'rape', 'consensual' or 'self'
$ARGS[4] 'gentle', 'rough' or 'unknown'
$ARGS[5] 'sober', 'tipsy', 'verydrunk', 'hornyfromdrugs' or 'unabletomove'
$ARGS[6] location description of where it happened. this should always start with 'in ...' for the automated messages
$ARGS[7] object used in case you did it yourself (my dildo, a cucumber, a magically conjured horsecock)

firstvagmsg1, firstvagmsg2, firstvagmsg3, firstanalmsg1, firstanalmsg2, firstanalmsg3, firstoralmsg1, firstoralmsg2, firstoralmsg3 are the generated responses.
msg1 includes age, partner, location and object if applicable
msg2 includes roughness
msg3 includes state

Examples:
gs 'virginity_call', 'anal', 'Kolka', 'known', 'consensual', 'gentle', 'tipsy', 'in my room', ''
gs 'virginity_call', 'vaginal', 'some guys', 'unknown', 'rape', 'rough', 'unabletomove', 'in their hotel room', 'various toys'
gs 'virginity_call', 'anal', 'unknown', 'unaware', 'rape', 'rough', 'sober', 'in a hotel room', ''
