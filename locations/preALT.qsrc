	'"Ah, you woke up," she chirped. "We found you half-dead, you know. You almost didnt make it. You shouldn''t be fondling ancient amulets you know nothing about."'
	'"I did some research on what happened to you. Turns out the Amulet of Power passed to you, which should only happen if touched by a male mage. Unfortunately, I got some bad news for you. Reinhold, who''s a really powerful mage. He''s been tracking down this amulet for a while now and if he realizes that the amulet''s power has passed to you he might think you pose a risk."'

		'"What the hell is going on?" you respond. You try to move your hands, but you''re tied to the bed.'
		'"Um, okay, I''ll start from the beginning," the girl says. "Magic exists and is real. Ages ago the world was not the same, the fae creatures who possess natural magic lived in balance but the succubus were free to breed with whom ever they wished."'
		'"They bred with humans and so human magicians were born. The Sidhe as the most powerful of the fae feared the increasing numbers of human magicians and cast a very powerful spell to bind the succubus to them, this prevented one from being able to reproduce without the other."'
		'"All magicians have some of that original fae blood in their bodies and it is through that that they are able to connect with the world of magic."'
		*nl
		'The redhead adjusts her glasses. "Most of the world simply ignores magic or are protected from it by magic''s natural desire to remain hidden."'
		'"But last night there was a powerful burst of magical energy, strong enough to be clearly seen by any with magical connections. Can you guess where this surge came from? Yeah, that cave you found. Apparently the surge occurred when you opened the seal to the archive. Anyway, that was when we started to search, that source of power is desired by many, but it is extremely dangerous and in the wrong hands could do untold horrors."'
		'She stops for a few seconds for you to process that information. It seems really far fetched.'

			'"So magic exists and is used by all these people and creatures, but the rest of us just don''t see it, or convince ourselves it didn''t happen?" You ask.'
			'The girl nods. "Yes. You''re a quick student. Machines, apartments, television and the Internet, all this really does exist and is in the form in which people see it. But if I say, hurl a fireball, then people might see that I threw a grenade or shot from a flamethrower. The human mind can''t process magic, so it blocks it as a way to protect the person from going crazy."'
			'"Hence such things as little green men, UFOs, poltergeists, spontaneous combustion, are when people encounter a difficult to hide phenomenon and the conclusion is flawed. In some cases, if someone''s mind can not cope with the spell they witness, they can be driven crazy and then no one believes them."'

				*clr & cla
				'<center><img <<$set_imgh>> src="images/pre/alt/karinpre.jpg"></center>'
				'"And who are you?" you ask.'
				'The girl smiled. "Me? I''m Tatiana, a young mage with a keen interest in magical phenomenon. I specialize in the treatment of mutations, and magic relating to the body. I have little combat skill, so I rely on the services of Gustav to provide some muscle. He''s a Mutant, his mutation is due to magical exposure and it gives him unmatched physical strength and he is a great tracker."'

					'"But this is not good for you. You may think that since you have the amulets'' power, you can do anything. But in reality, you''re helpless without the skill to use it. Its power already knocked you out and I had to use magic to stabilize you."'

"It was made by the trickster Rikudo, one of the most powerful ancient magicians before he died, he taunted the only living mage who could control its immense power by cursing him to be stuck in a female form and making it only activate for a male mage."'
						'"Great. So I''ve been thrown into this mess by the dead owner of that ancient tomb. Hang on, I''m not male or a mage, how could the power be transferred to me?"'
						'"It seems that its long time underground has caused it to malfunction and its power has entered your body."'
						'"You are lucky to be a woman," Tatiana adds, "Rikudo''s power seems to only work if it is in a man''s body. Since you cannot harness its power you shouldn''t arouse suspicion."'
