'You wake up in in an unfamiliar room. Standing near you is the same red-haired girl that entered your hotel room.'
'"Ah, you''re awake," she chirps. "I told this jerk Juugo that he should have treated you more carefully, but he''s bad at listening. As a result, I had you pull from the world, he almost knocked you out permanently."'
'"But some good news, while you were unconscious, I did some research on you. Turns out the Amulet of Power passed to you. Must have happened when you touched it. Unfortunately, I got some bad news for you too. Toby, well, that guy in the mask. He''s probably realized by now that the amulet no longer has the power and now he''s out to hunt you down."'

	'"What the hell is going on?" you respond. You try to move your hands, but you''re tied to the bed.'
	'"Um, okay, I''ll start from the beginning," the girl says. "Magic exists and is real. Ages ago the world was not the same, magicians were prominent and magic was accepted and considered normal."'
	'"However one day everything changed. The Order of Dawn is responsible for that. That masked man you encountered, his name is Toby and he is the head of that order. What they did was capture several demons and used their power to cast a grand spell, that bewitched the entire world."' 
	'The redhead adjusts her glasses. "You would never know it, but the whole world exists within an illusion, with Toby in direct control. Someone may try to rebel against the illusion, but due to its powerful magic, most of the world has simply forgotten about magic and went to live on in the illusory world, which they believe is real."'
	'"But last night there was a powerful burst of magical energy, strong enough to even cause a malfunction in Tsukuemi. Tsukuemi is the name of that illusory spell imposed on the moon. Can you guess where magicians felt this surge? It was that cave you found. Apparently the surge occurred at the activation of the amulet. Anyways, the hunting began, many mages from all the different factions went looking for that source of power capable of disrupting the Tsukuemi illusion."'
	'She stops for a few seconds for you process that information. It seems really far fetched.' 
	'"As you can figure out, Toby wants to prevent the destruction of his Tsukuemi spell. And perhaps use the amulet''s power to strengthen it since the spell has weakened over the ages."'

		'"The whole world is in a... Tsukuemi illusion that Toby casted?" You ask.'
		'The girl nods. "Yes. But the illusion is very specific. Your perception of normal physical things are real. The spell has hidden only the Magical aspect to the normal person. Machines, apartments, television and the Internet, all this really does exist and is in the form in which people see it. But if I say, hurl a fireball, then people will see that I threw a grenade or shot from a flamethrower. Once the human mind meets magic, Tsukuemi acts and influences the mind, blocking it from seeing a miracle"'
		'"Hence such things as little green men, UFOs, poltergeists, spontaneous combustion, are the effects of Tsukuemi using shortcuts when people encounter a difficult to hide phenomenon. And in some cases, if someone''s mind can not cope with the influence of Tsukuemi, the spell can can drive the person crazy and then no one would ever believe them."'

			'The girl smiled. "Me? I''m Karin, a mage, but not someone from the Order of Dawn like the sorcerer Toby. I specialize in the treatment of mutations, and body changing magic. I have little warcasting or combat training, so I rely on the services of Juugo in situations like retrieving you. He''s a Mutant, his mutation is due to his magical nature and it gives him unmatched physical strength. But unfortunately with this power, the Tsukuemi spell is impacting his psychological stability. So we work together, I keep him in a state of sanity and he acts as my muscle when needed."'

				'"Hmm, well... power obviously," Karin replies. "When I looked for you, I was hoping to get that object of power. But now the situation has changed. The amulet pretty much became useless, as its power passed on to you."'
				'"But this is not good for you. You may think that since you have the amulets'' power, you can do anything. But in reality, you''re helpless without the skills to use it. Toby easily overpowered your will and forced you to obey, and Juugo beat you like a puppy. So you are essentially a walking amulet with a big target painted on your back."'

					'"And what is this amulet? Where did it come from?" you ask.'
					'Karin thinks about it for a few moments. "My guess is, that it was made by the trickster Rikudo, the ancient magician of stunning force. I do not know how precisely, but the amulet was created in a special way. Perhaps it only gives power to someone who can''t control magic. And it also seems to empower men. The amulet could be Rikudo''s emergency power, or even how the magician transferred his power when he passed away."' 
					'Great. So I''ve been thrown into this mess by the dead owner of that ancient tomb.'
					'"You know, you''re already a dead man walking. Toby and his order of bastards are likely already on your trail. When he finds you, he will turn you inside out in order to get that amulet''s power. I''m pretty sure Tsukuemi can''t affect you, and you probably saw how Toby moves. You can''t outrun that."'
					'You recall that moment after following his orders and handing over the amulet, Tobys eye spun and sort of twisted out into thin air. Considering how easily he found you first, Karin''s right.'
					'"But," Karin adds, "I do not want to give you to Toby. And I think I know how to mislead his bloodhounds. Rikudo''s power seems to only work if it is in a man''s body. You''re a man and that power is practically steaming off of you, regardless of your will. It would take way too much effort to dispel traces of this power wherever you hide."'

						'Your eyes widen in shock.'
						'"Well, there is another way, I can just stop your heart and let your power dissolve into nature, but you will die. As I said, I''m not going to let Order of Dawn catch you, and I don''t want to kill you. Maybe with more time doing research I can do something more sensible with the amulets'' power in you."'

							'"As for your family, not to worry. I''ll arrange everything. We will fabricate your death to get Toby off your back. To make your transition easier I''ll cover your memory of the family, they will only be ghostly memories, you won''t even remember where you lived. Don''t worry, I won''t erase your entire memory and leave you a useless vegetable."'

You will need a to use a new name, think it over in your dreams and tell me when you wake up, otherwise I will give you a pretty name. Now go to sleep." Says Karin as she puts her hand on your chest. Your vision immediately fades.'
