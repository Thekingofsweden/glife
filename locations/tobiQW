	'"Sit. We have a long conversation, I''m not going to kill you. Things happened, now we make the best of it.'
	'You sit down on the bed. Toby begins to talk.'
	'"When I took the amulet and not you, I miscalculated, I did not know that the power had passed to you. When I returned to the room, you were gone, there was no trace of who had clearly removed all traces very well. This someone is not weaker than me. Remember this fact, Karins skill is not enough to trick me.'
	'"The next day I find out about your alleged death. And here the owner Karin made her biggest mistake."'
	'Surprised you say. "What? Everything seems to go smoothly."'
	'"Yes, all passed smoothly, we waited for the funeral of the body and then it got. Perfect copy, masterful work. I wouldn''t have thought Karin could do it, I did not even know about its existence.'
	'"The owner Karin thought she knows a lot about the Order of Dawn, but still not enough. She did not know that Payne has the ability to find the souls of the dead and bring them back to life. We brought the body to life and it turned out that this man has nothing to do with you. Someone just took a passerby in the street, recreated your appearance and killed him. Payne also has the ability to see everything in a person, even when he is born, through the eyes of this man, unfortunately it kills them. Payne saw everything."'
	'You plead, "Nothing I have could be useful to someone as powerful as this Payne."'
	'"Payne, the true owner of all that is in the tomb. He is a true master of the force that is in you. His avatar Rikudo, the living embodiment of God, capable of destroying the city in one motion, raises the dead, can see through people, can change their body as he pleases, can have many bodies at the same time, control the weather, gravity, live in several worlds, see whole continents, his eyes such that even the mouse does not slip from his sight, and God knows what he owns, it is incomprehensible even to me."'

	'"So who''s this boss of Karin and what does he want?"'
	'"That''s the fun part! But to continue in order. When Payne checked the memory of the corpse depicting you, he did not see the face of a magician, but I heard his voice, vile snake hiss, it could only be Orochimaru."'
	'"Orochimaru? Never heard of such a thing."'
	'"Not surprising. You were not looking for him and it wouldn''t cross your mind to find a killer of mages. His name is not even said out loud, when suddenly and fatally struck on the head, he is a real threat to the powerful magicians. We were once close friends with him, he was in the Dawn."'
	'"He is an exceptionally gifted magician, a very wise, ancient and immortal sorcerer. Owns nearly all the possible techniques of magic, many of his techniques beyond comprehension."'
	'"But Orochimaru pay dearly for immortality. There is no eternal life without eternal fee for it. His real body has long been dead, he lives in the wrong bodies. These bodies are called donor vessels, the receptacle of his soul. Vessels but do not live long, only three or four years, then the vessel rejects Orochimarus soul. And Orochimaru is limited by the strength of the vessel."'
	'"So, after examination of the body, it became clear you were taken from under our noses by Orochimaru. We began to stalk him, Payne can differentiate amongst all that is in the rain, it was he who sheds it so often. We tracked down Orochimarus location he once showed his true face, a snake in the rain. But there was no sign that he took the power himself. We have concluded from that, you were still alive, Orochimarus technology was targeting you with unexpected focus."'
	'Just about keeping up, ask, "Since you tracked me down and why worry about this Orochimaru."'
	'"Stupid child! Orochimaru wants to make your body a vessel for his soul. He trained with the help of Karin and you developed, that would your body came into full force, do not forget, his level is tied to the strength of the vessel."'
	'"Karin tells you what you want to hear, she develops your body for her master Orochimaru so that he can use it as a new vessel. Do you even know what fate Karin has prepared for you? You just erased, in your place Orochimaru."'
	'You think "Damn, I''m in between a rock and a hard place Toby and Orochimaru, and what to do now?"'
	'"By changing your sex, Orochimaru made you useless for Payne and me, we do not need you and cannot use. Frankly, we spit on you now. I continued to look for you, but out of a desire to resolve the situation. Understand Orochimaru plans to this effect.'
	'"I had to use Zetsu as a spy, and that would force Payne to track all magicians, we found Karin, but she is not known to us, but we found Juugo, and only then did we know exactly she was. She was experimenting for Orochimaru."'
	'"Then Payne saw you. How you go to Karin and she teaches you, Paine saw as you leap through the levels of magic. Any magician spends decades to grow to your current level. How long did it take you this time? You were practicing a technique for an hour, and magicians study for years to learn it. It became clear that you imagine yourself safe. So I came to visit you."'

	'"And now to the point. Yeah, we''re not interested in you, we really can not take your power now. But this does not mean that we just give up such a powerful vessel to Orochimaru."'
	'"I would have already tried to kill Orochimaru, or sent Payne to do it, I think Payne would have easily killed him in battle. The problem is that Orochimarus magic is too great and he an use it to avoid fighting."'

When the time comes, you go and kill Karin and Juugo. It will make it clear that it was the Dawn who ordered it, Orochimaru all understand, and will try to grab you himself.

Mages went to war at the age of 6 - 10 years old, fought until at least 16. All fought against all. Violence begets violence. Me in 7 years during the battle crushed the right side of my face. I lost an eye and became compelled to hide what''s left of my face behind the mask. I wed mighty magician, who was later killed. Everyone I knew and loved, killed, and I could not do anything about it. You just can not imagine a world in which almost all magicians with forces capable of destroying entire cities. Banal drunken brawl in a bar wrapped in a bloody mess with thousands of victims. People ran wild and destroy each other. Mankind fell on the edge of a precipice. Then I decided to put an end to this massacre not die."'

	'(Toby) - Of course, this situation is not like the other magicians. Therefore, we are in a constant struggle. At Dawn has no friends, only enemies but we still have a whole bunch of magicians who managed to avoid the influence Tsukuemi example preserved a Hidden Order Foliage, they at every opportunity we try to insert a stick in the wheel. But we shouldered this burden voluntarily accept his cross for the sake of humanity as a whole, and not wanting to assert themselves a handful of magicians. Particularly zealous mages going to seize power we consume, those who try to intrude into the work Tsukuemi we also consume. Others do not touch until they climb on the rampage.

He will not teach you for free, even if I asked. He is the oldest of living on the planet, and the most greedy, I will ask him that he would teach you, but do not anger him, and he will kill you, no joke.
