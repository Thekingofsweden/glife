I miscalculated something, for example due to sharp hormonal change you have bad acme on your face and I failed to change your eyes and lips. On the bright side, your body will change much faster than one of a natural born woman. That means it will be easier to gain and lose weight and change facial features. All in all you turned quite well. By the way, your new ''equipment'' down there is fully functional, so if you don''t want to be a mother, you should think about using contraceptives."'
