										'"And who are you?" you ask.'
										'The girl smiled. "Me? I''m Tatiana, a young mage with an keen interest in magical phenomenon. I specialize in the treatment of mutations, and magic relating to the body. I have little combat skill, so I rely on the services of Gustav to provide some muscle. He''s a Mutant due to magical exposure. It gives him unmatched physical strength, plus he''s a great tracker."'
										'"The two of us run a detective agency for cover and money, but our real objective is studying magic and its effects."'

										act 'What do you want from me?':
											*clr & cla
											'<center><img <<$set_imgh>> src="images/pre/shared/karinpre.jpg"></center>'
											'"And what is this amulet? Where did it come from?" you ask.'
											'Tatiana thinks about it for a few moments. "It was made by the trickster Rikudo, one of the most powerful ancient magicians. He taunted the only living mage who could control its immense power by cursing him to be stuck in a female form, yet making it only activate for a male mage."'
											'"I''m not a mage though, how could the power be transferred to me? And what does that have to do with turning me into a girl?"'
											'"Well as for how the power was transferred, it seems that its long time underground caused it to malfunction and its power to enter your body. It was far too powerful for your body and would have ended up killing you and who knows how many others. Which is where the ''turning you into a girl'' part comes in."'

											act 'Continue':
												*clr & cla
												'<center><img <<$set_imgh>> src="images/pre/shared/karinpre.jpg"></center>'
												'"See, when I found you I could feel the aura of power emanating from you. That made it easy to put things together. I knew enough about the Amulet to know that the power would have destroyed you. So I drew from that aura to transform you into someone who was protected from the masculine alignment of the power."'
												'Tatiana runs a hand through her hair and giggles. "So I made you into a pretty teenage girl. Now the power is going to lie dormant, saving you from blowing up a city or something."'
												'"Wasn''t there any other way? Taking away my manhood is a pretty drastic move!"'

												act 'Continue':
													*clr & cla
													'<center><img <<$set_imgh>> src="images/pre/shared/karinpre.jpg"></center>'
													'"Of course there was another way. I could have just stopped your heart and let your power dissolve into nature. You would have died though. Reinhold might be the kind of person to kill you to save others, but I didn''t want to kill you right after saving you. Plus with my magic I was able to take this risk. Sure, maybe with more time doing research I could have worked out another solution, but I didn''t have a lot of time."'
													'"Of course I couldn''t just leave a newly teenage girl without parents or a home. So I decided to kill two birds with one stone. Instead of just turning you into the girl version of you, I turned you into that girl you were with."'

													act 'What?':
														*clr & cla

														'Startled, you reach up to your face, tracing out the features. You didn''t get a chance to become familiar with her face, but it feels about right. This whole time, the death of <<$pcs_nickname>> didn''t feel real, like she was still around somehow. Maybe it''s because you now "are" <<$pcs_nickname>>, but even now you don''t feel a sense of loss or guilt.'
														'"Having a template to work off of really helped. Not even a geneticist could tell you two apart; you are identical from your fingerprints down to your DNA. Of course, that means your new ''equipment'' down there is fully functional as well, so if you don''t want to be a mommy, you should start thinking about contraceptives. You should probably also stay away from any male relatives if you don''t want to end up with a kid with eleven toes or something."'
														'You angrily look at Tatiana, "So you think I''m a complete woman? On the outside I''ll look like one, but guess what, I''m still a man!"'
														'"Well, yes. I won''t argue about that." Tatiana agrees. "You can decide what you want to do with your life, but you might want to play the part of <<$pcs_firstname>> until graduation at least. On a side note, I already took care of an alibi. Yesterday, "<<$pcs_firstname>>" was found half-dead on the edge of the woods while the leftovers of Peter''s body were found deeper in. It''s in the news."

															'You give Tatiana a bewildered look. She has an enigmatic smile, "Well, I am a magician. That''s something that I can do. Reinhold has definitely lost the trail; there''s no reason he should suspect the power been passed to a girl. You took <<$pcs_firstname>>''s place, and she took yours. The body that ''died'' in the woods was a perfect copy of your old self, from your absorbed amulet energy down to the placement of every single hair."'
															'"Anyways, your ''mother'' will be by in a couple hours to pick you up; she thinks that you''ve got some amnesia from a head injury and mental trauma from seeing your ''boyfriend'' get eaten alive by wolves, so you should probably be covered for any slip-ups. Just play the part of the traumatized little schoolgirl and it should be all good. Have fun."'
