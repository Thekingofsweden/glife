					'His political career is his last chance to get back to where he once was." She stops talking for a few seconds to pour more wine in the glasses, and as she does you can clearly see her hands shaking violently. "You see this rich house? Guard at the entrance, expensive furniture, all this luxury? It''s all a charade. My father isn''t even on the verge of bankruptcy, he is already far beyond.
