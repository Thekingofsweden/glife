		'"Okay, uh..." It''s strange how easily you sometimes forget how normal people talk. "Where are you from?"'
		'"Ever heard of a little place called ''Colombia''?"'
		'"Um... Maybe?" You''ve seen it written on a map somewhere, probably in one of the Americas, but your face gives away that, beyond knowing it''s a country, you have no idea.'
		'"Well, let''s just say that it''s not a very nice country to live in, unless you are willing to sell your soul. But it''s always warm and the women..." He shakes his head wistfully. "Ay-ay-ay, the women are hot and... ''passionate''."'
		'"''Passionate''?"'
		'He chuckles. "They are quick to love, but just as quick to anger."'

		'"Can I ask you something?"'
		*nl

		'"Sorry, I didn''t mean to pry." You quickly decide to drop the subject. "You just... stand out, you know?"'

		'"Your politicians are corrupt, your booze is cheap, your girls are as pretty as they are easy...", he gives you a suggestive grin. "Feels just like home."'

		*nl
		'"So, if I went to a club full of horny guys my age and drank there, you wouldn''t think I''m easy?"'
		'He shakes his head. "Most clubs I know are at least as seedy as my bar - same difference."'
		'"Well, maybe I''m here because I like the atmosphere?"'

		*nl

His shell may be hard but there''s definitely more to him than that. You''re not sure that his core is soft, but whatever it is, it''s bound to be interesting. And as strange as this episode was, it feels like something changed, like, after chipping away at it for a while, you finally broke the ice.'
