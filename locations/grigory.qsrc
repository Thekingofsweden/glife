			act 'Let him go alone':

				'Moving quickly, you get into the passenger side of the vehicle right as the engine roars to life. A few seconds later, the truck is in motion.'
				'After a short drive, Grigory slows the vehicle as he pulls to a stop in front of his home.'
				'There''s a sudden silence as he turns the key, killing the engine. Then without removing the key, he swings open his door and starts to get out. The truck rocks heavily when he grabs his door for support.'
				'Realizing he''s leaving his keys, you reach over and remove them from the ignition before getting out your own side of the truck.'
				'By the time you close the door behind yourself, Grigory is already walking clumsily towards the house. At the door, the large man starts to pat his pockets, looking for the key to the front door. You jingle the keys he had forgotten and are rewarded with a sheepish grin from him. Stepping to the door, you unlock it and turn the knob to open it.'
				'Gregory enters a couple of paces behind you, having the presence of mind to close the door behind himself.'
				'You turn on a light, then walk further into the house to turn the bedroom light on. Somewhere behind you, you hear him bump into something. '
				'Turning to look, you see Gregory only half way across the living room of the house, an end table several inches from where you had last seen it beside him. His shirt is on the floor behind him and his pants are just sliding past his knees. All the while, he''s swaying dangerously as he tries to pull first one, then the other, boot off his feet.'
				'When he reaches the bedroom door, he''s managed to loose his pants just a few paces behind himself and is reaching for his underwear. He gives you a smile that would seem lecherous from anyone else, but just looks cute on his weathered face.'
				'Stepping further into the room, you pull back the covers for him.'
				'"Kiska," He says drunkedly, "I''m going to make love to you." '
				'You turn just in time to see him half reach, half fall, towards you. You quickly move out of the way to avoid being crushed by him.'
				'He ends up falling about two thirds onto the bed, and after a couple of minutes, you''re able to get him the rest of the way onto the bed. By then, you can hear the soft sounds of his snoring.'
				'You can''t help but smile while looking at him, his naked ass sticking up into the air. You quickly pull the covers over him.'
				'After a few seconds consideration, you pull remove your own shoes, then pull back the covers on the other side of the bed before crawling in beside him.'
				'Snuggling up against the warmth of his big body, you feel him roll onto his side, one of his arms slipping around your middle. "Love you Kiska," He mumbles in his drunken sleep.'

The first thing you notice is that all of Grigory''s clothes have been picked up, and that the end table has been moved back to where it belongs. The second is when you look out the living room window and notice that his truck is gone.'

		'The grip lingers for another second, then he lets go suddenly. '
		'Your chest aches just a little as you take a deep breath. After a few seconds of breathing again, "Grigory?" You call his name softly, keeping just a little distance between the two of you, "I never mean to hurt you, if I tease you a little, its because you''re my friend."'
		'"Friend," The word sounds bitter coming from Grigory''s mouth.'
		'"I think you need to go home, get some sleep," You venture, "Can I help you to your truck?" Even as you ask, you wonder how you''d ever be able to help the giant of a man get to his truck considering how much smaller than him you are.'
		'Taking a step towards you again, he doesn''t embrace you this time, instead he leans forward, his lips touching your forehead. The smell of alcohol is strong on him, "Later Kiska," He mumbles, then turns and starts walking away.'
