The cafe is where your mother works can, also, be found near the train station. It caters to the visitors coming in by train. The downtown area has most of the businesses and some middle class housing. The residential area is a mixture of houses and Soviet-era apartment blocks. Some of the wealthiest families live in houses near the park that''s on the outskirts of town. While the poorest homes are found near the old industrial area where several old factories has long since been closed down, lay abandoned, and are run down. The only factory that is still open is the G&M clothing factory which also has a local store front and a tailor that can adjust your clothing. The industrial area is now mostly a home to prostitutes and drugs dealers. It is not considered a safe area to walk around at night. Despite being a tourist destination the area is seen as fairly poor and without many jobs.'

In the school there are four different cliques that most of the students belong to while the rest are the outcasts who no one wants to have anything to do with unless it is to pick on or abuse them. The old school building was left to rot and is now a shell of its former self. It''s sometimes used by the students as a place to hang out. '

Next are the jocks or the athletes, they are all into one or more sports and spend most of their time working out or playing sports. They look down on those with no athletic ability.
