!Scene ideas:
! - Bar Threesome Dream

!An event chain where some random guy pays for Svetas drink, with multiple outcomes:
!- Not interested and nothing happens;
!- Not interested and rape (but Martin steps in);
!- Roofied (but Martin steps in);
!- Drunk sex somewhere else;
!- Drunk sex on the toilet;
!- Pleasant banter and potential boyfriend;

!IDEAS FOR SCENES:
!You have an over protective barman so realistically the sex is either with him or off the premises.
!Being the industrial area at night then there are going to be quiet streets or car parks for the sexy-times and if its a nicer guy there''s a hotel above the casino.
!You can have it not unlike the dance in Pav with guys asking Sveta if she wants to ''step out'' with them (you could have it as a way for Sveta to earn so ''tips'' but the BBQ in the same area does that probably not).
!Throw in a couple looking to spice things up (hotel for sure), some guys looking for a slut to use and a woman looking for some lesbian company and you''ve covered all bases.
