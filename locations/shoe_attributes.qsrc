!! ShoQuality = 1-7 scale, based on the general expensiveness of the clothing. Higher is more expensive.
!!		Notes: 7 is for shoes that might only be found on celebrities or millionaires at red carpet events.
!! 		Ex:		6-5 are the higher and lower levels of the expensive category
!!				4-3 are the same for average category
!!				2-1 are the same for cheap category.
!! ShoHeels = 1-6 scale, with higher values being taller heels.

!!				5 Thigh high
!!				4 for approx. knee high
!!				3 for calf high
!!				2 for ankle high
!!				1 for shoes
