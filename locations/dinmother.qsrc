We went to the same school when we were young, and were dating back then... nothing serious. Things weren''t great between us, but then I got pregnant with your sister Anya. Our parents forced us to get married. We tried to make the most of it, and for a while things didn''t seem so bad. A few months after I had you, we got into a huge argument though. We decided we couldn''t live together any more, and got divorced." You can''t help but notice she won''t tell you what the argument was about, but you don''t interrupt her. It''s rare enough to get her to talk about your real father as it is.'
		'"A year later I married Vladimir, your stepfather. We had Kolka together, but Vladimir always treated you and Anya as if they were his own daughters too. He looked after you, bathed you, told you stories at night and took you for walks whenever he could." Those memories seem to have cheered her up, and she has a serene smile on her face. "Vladimir really is a wonderful man..." she adds, while you thank her for the story and let her get back to what she was doing.'
