You would be working between 16:00 and 19:00, give or take. Most of the hotel rooms are empty then, before the new guests come in. You can come work any day you like, no pressure. It would pay 250 rubles per shift. After your work, you can immediately go collect your salary at the reception, or you can save it up and collect it all at once later. Does that sound good to you?"'

			'Herman continues: "If you want to work a shift, you need to be here between 16:00 and 17:00. There''s no point in you getting changed for just 20 minutes of work."'
			'That also sounds fair. You give him a handshake as you get ready to leave: "Okay. Thank you sir!"'
