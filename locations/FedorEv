				'Vitek nods: "Good plan. Set it up, will you?" He then turns to Fedor: "We''re settling this tomorrow, kid. You better be here after school, it''ll be ten times worse for you if you don''t."'
				'He then waves for his friends to follow him: "Come on guys. Let''s go have some beers in the park, I need to relax. <<$name>>, if you want to join us, you know where we''ll be." Vitek and Dan leave Fedor on the ground and head for the schoolyard exit, but Vasily walks over to Fedor and kicks him in the ribs one more time, still laughing that signature jackal laugh of his.
