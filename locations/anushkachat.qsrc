I started hanging out with them right after they started their band. Val told me about Rad and him starting a band. He invited me to come listen to them."'
			'You just nod as you listen as she continues. "Anyways, they were kinda crap honestly back then, since they could barely play while the lyrics were awful. They mostly just did covers to practice with back then." She pauses a moment as if remembering what it was like. "Even back then, Rad was a decent singer, a bit on the raw, but you could hear the natural talent. He use to look at me with that look. It was the one that boys would give you when they really want you. Back then it felt amazing to be looked at that way, but now I know what that look really means," she finishes with a frown.'

He paid attention to me in the way young girls want guys to pay attention to them," she says with a laugh and shakes her head, "God, I was so stupid back then.

He taught me what he knew and we both got better. I also helped him write original songs for the band. In time, I asked him if I could join, so he let me try out. Rad and Val agreed, shit head didn''t." She notices the look on your face to her shit head comment she adds, "He was the bands previous drummer. He was a real asshole."'

I just don''t mean with the local kids, but we started to playing at some parties. At the time we just got free booze, drugs, and got to hang out with older kids.

They had never before paid me any attention before. The girls were doing the same with the boys, but I didn''t care. Rad and I were together."'
					'You can tell she is starting to get visibly upset, but not angry. It''s like she might actually be on the verge of crying. She takes a deep, calming breath to get herself back under control. Her vulnerable moment passes. "It happened after one of the underground parties we played at. After we was done, we joined in with the dancing and partying. I noticed Rad wasn''t anywhere to be seen, so I went to look for him... Yeah I found him fucking some other chick." Now she seems to be angry with saying that, "We fought over him cheating on me. He said he was sorry and wouldn''t do it anymore, so I forgave him. God, I was so fucking stupid," she says harshly.'
					'"However, he didn''t stop because I always caught him several more times with different sluts. I kept taking him back and forgiving him. He had the nerve to fucking dump me that fucking asshole. He says it is what is best for the band." She goes quiet for a moment while looking kinda sad.'
					'"In the end he was right. We should have never dated and should have broken up sooner. It was a good PR move for the band if we both are single to create the fantasy that our fans having a chance with us. It took me awhile to come to that realization," she says shaking her head.'
