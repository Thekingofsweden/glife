# succubus

!!The verious calls for succubus specific events
!!Varible identification:

!!	scpopt; a flag to indicate that a call is optional for some reason, set at the calling location: 0: No, 1: Yes, 2: option taken
!!	$sclocrt; a string to indicate where a call came from if $loc may not have been set, set at the calling location when needed
!!	$scargrt; a string to set by the $ARGS from the calling location if $metca may not have been set, set at the calling location when needed
!!	$scsubloc; a string to allow a sub-routine in this location to call another and still get back to the first
