Someone may try to rebel against the illusion, but due to its powerful magic, most of the world has simply forgotten about magic and went to live on in the illusory world, which they believe is real."'

Can you guess where magicians felt this surge? It was that cave you found. Apparently the surge occurred at the activation of the amulet. Anyways, the hunting began, many mages of all stripes went looking for that source of power capable of disrupting the Tsukuemi illusion."'

Machines, apartments, television and the Internet, all this really does exist and is in the form in which people see it. But if I say, hurl a fireball, then people will see that I threw a grenade or shot from a flamethrower. Once the human mind meets magic, Tsukuemi acts and influences the mind, blocking it from seeing a miracle"'
            '"Hence such things as little green men, UFOs, poltergeists, spontaneous combustion, are the effects of Tsukuemi using shortcuts when people encounter a difficult to hide phenomenon. And in some cases, if someone''s mind can not cope with the influence of Tsukuemi, the spell can can drive the person crazy and then no one would ever believe them."'

I specialize in the treatment of mutations, and body changing magic. I have little warcasting or combat training, so I rely on the services of Juugo in situations like retrieving you. He''s a Mutant, his mutation is due to his magical nature and it gives him unmatched physical strength. But unfortunately with this power, the Tsukuemi spell is impacting his psychological stability. So we work together, I keep him sane and he acts as my muscle when needed."'

Toby can easily overpower your will and forced you to obey, and Juugo can kick your ass. So you are essentially a walking amulet with a big target painted on your back."'

I do not know how precisely, but the amulet was created in a special way. Perhaps it only gives power to someone can''t control magic. And it also seems to empower men. The amulet could be Rikudo''s emergency power, or even how the magician transferred his power when he passed away."'
